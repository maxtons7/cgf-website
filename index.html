            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Causal Governance Framework (CGF) is a strategic, data-informed initiative that confronts the structural barriers faced by ethnic minority millennials and generations to come. Rooted in decades of global governance, UN diplomacy, and intergenerational leadership, CGF delivers practical, inclusive policy innovation anchored in real-world lived experience.</p>
            <p>Through its digital-first platform and AI-informed policy labs, CGF aims to ensure historically marginalised communities shape the trajectory of economic transformation, health equity, and social mobility. We are committed to building governance systems that reflect causality—not coincidence—in how opportunity is distributed.</p>
