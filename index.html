            <h2>CGF Values Charter</h2>
            <p>The Causal Governance Framework (CGF) is founded on the principle that governance must serve the governed — not the gatekeepers. We reject systems driven by coincidence, inertia, and institutional apathy. Instead, we commit to intentionality, equity, and accountability in every dimension of our work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Causality over Coincidence</strong> — Outcomes must be traceable to effort, policy, and intent — not to privilege, luck, or legacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence-led Change</strong> — Every CGF position is informed by data, context, and the lived realities of those most affected.</li>
                <li><strong>Intergenerational Equity</strong> — Governance must serve tomorrow, not just today. We reject short-termism disguised as progress.</li>
                <li><strong>Global-Local Synergy</strong> — We act locally with an awareness of global structures — and push for coherence between the two.</li>
                <li><strong>Radical Inclusion</strong> — Marginalised voices are not invited as guests; they are positioned as architects.</li>
                <li><strong>Transparency with Teeth</strong> — We don’t just publish. We explain, simplify, and make space for challenge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p><strong>Who We Are</strong></p>
            <p>CGF was born out of necessity. It was forged through the lived experiences of ethnic minority leaders, veterans, UN diplomats, and policy strategists who recognised a common truth: the system is not broken — it was built this way. We are not a think tank. We are a strategic policy lab rooted in action, committed to dismantling structural inequality using data, diplomacy, and design.</p>
            <p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
            <p>To build a governance framework where outcomes are not accidental but engineered — where power is redistributed, and opportunity is no longer inherited, but made.</p>
